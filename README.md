# ComputerBuild
Repository of Pictures from my first computer build

I built my first computer at 15 in 2015. From there, I have gone to create a local business providing partslists, consultations, advice, and full builds. I've built several workstations, servers, and gaming rigs for friends, family, and customers. 

This was the beginning of my journey into computer hardware. I've learned so much.
